Weather API Project

The summary overview is located in the WeatherPy2_Summary_Overview.docx as well as within the .ipny file

A Google Map of all the Cities (WeatherPy2_Random_Cities_Google_Maps_View_12-21-2018.png) was generated to show the random generation and location of the Cities around the Globe generated for this project analyses.

Google Map would not save in GitHub Jupyter Notebook environment.

NOTE:
api key files are not included to maintain security of API keys utilized.

worldcitiespot.text was not included as GIT BASH communicated the file was too large to upload
